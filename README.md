# RUSTBOOK

## Objective

This repository is a training ground for the language Rust. 
It mostly follows the lead of the [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html).
A more detailed but less beginner friendly exists in the form of the [Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/introduction.html).

## Organization

The different folders correspond to exercises and examples of the Rust Book chapters, and are correspondingly organized. The first number indicates the chapter, the second is the section/paragraph/exercise. 

## Ownership 

I do not own any of the files used by Cargo or Rust (rustup, rustc...) nor do I claim ownership of Rust. 
The Copyright and Licensing of Rust is readily available at the base of the repository.
